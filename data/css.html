      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. "Cascading" refers to the
      priority-based application of styles, and "Style Sheets" refer to the
      sheets used to define the style and layout of a document. CSS is used in
      conjunction with HTML to specify the design, layout, and presentation of
      web pages written in HTML. With CSS, you can define the style and
      appearance of various elements on a web page. For example, you can design
      the text and images of a web page by setting properties such as font,
      color, background, spacing, and alignment. Additionally, CSS enables you
      to enhance the visual effects of a web page by implementing responsive web
      design or adding animation effects. CSS can be included within the HTML
      document using the style tag or linked as an external CSS file. Style
      sheets are composed of selectors and properties, where selectors are used
      to target HTML elements for styling, and properties define the style of
      those elements. CSS is an essential component in web development, playing
      a significant role in shaping the design and layout of web pages.
