      JavaScript is a programming language used to provide dynamic functionality
      to web pages. It is primarily used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to
      implement the behavior and interactivity of web pages. JavaScript runs on
      web browsers and is known as a client-side scripting language. It is
      executed directly in the user's web browser when a web page is loaded,
      rather than being processed on the server. By using JavaScript, you can
      add various features to web pages. For example, you can dynamically change
      content in response to user input, manipulate or create elements within
      the web page, and perform tasks such as time delays, animations, form
      validation, and data processing. JavaScript is a powerful and flexible
      language that is an essential component in web development. More recently,
      with the introduction of platforms like Node.js, JavaScript can also be
      executed on the server-side, expanding its usage beyond the client-side.
      This has transformed JavaScript into a versatile programming language that
      is utilized across various aspects of web development.
